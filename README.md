# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Horizon SEO

This is my first weekly challenge submission for Washington University Coding Bootcamp. These files make up the index page of a fictitious company's website. This project was made by cloning [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram|the starter code provided here] and refactoring it. I've modified it with alt text, semantic HTML containers, and cleaned-up CSS. I had to manually change the config file to be able to push it here; by next week I'll know how to skip that step.

To run this project, download the files and open `index.html` in your browser of choice.
